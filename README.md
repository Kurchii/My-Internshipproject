Question Class:

Create a Question class with attributes such as questionText, options, and correctAnswer.
Include a method to check if a given answer is correct.
java
Copy code
public class Question {
    private String questionText;
    private String[] options;
    private int correctAnswerIndex;

    // Constructor, getters, and setters

    public boolean isCorrect(int userAnswerIndex) {
        return userAnswerIndex == correctAnswerIndex;
    }
}
Quiz Class:

Develop a Quiz class to manage a collection of questions.
Include methods to add questions, retrieve questions, and calculate the total score.
java
Copy code
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Quiz {
    private List<Question> questions;
    private int userScore;

    // Constructor, getters, and setters

    public void addQuestion(Question question) {
        questions.add(question);
    }

    public Question getQuestion(int index) {
        return questions.get(index);
    }

    public int calculateScore(List<Integer> userAnswers) {
        // Iterate through user answers and update score
        // You may want to handle index out of bounds or other error scenarios
    }
}
User Interaction:

Implement a console-based user interface using the Scanner class.
Display questions, capture user responses, and provide feedback.
java
Copy code
import java.util.Scanner;

public class QuizApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize Quiz and add questions
        // Start quiz by displaying questions, capturing user input, and providing feedback
    }
}
Input Validation:

Ensure proper validation of user input using try-catch blocks or conditional statements.
Submission:

Create a GitHub repository for your project.
Include a README file explaining the project structure, how to run it, and any additional information.
Provide a link to your repository in the submission form.
This is a basic structure to get you started. As you work on the project, you can enhance it with features like randomizing questions, adding a timer, or improving the user interface. Good luck with your Java Online Quiz Application!
